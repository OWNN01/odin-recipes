    <p>Recipes Details</p>

    <p>This spicy turkey burger recipe uses some of the same techniques and seasonings
        from shish kebab to improve an otherwise dull turkey burger.
        For something made with meat that's 95% fat free, it's pretty good!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds ground turkey</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons ground almonds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili paste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed and minced</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine ground turkey, breadcrumbs, almonds, chili paste, garlic, ginger, salt, garam masala, lemon juice,
            yogurt, and cilantro. Mix thoroughly with a spatula or clean hands.</li>
        <li>Shape turkey mixture into a ball and divide into 4 even pieces. Refrigerate for 1 hour. Form each piece into
            a patty with damp hands. Return patties to refrigerator until grill is hot.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium heat. Grill turkey burgers until patty appears to be cooked about halfway up the
            side and then flip, grilling each side for about 4 to 5 minutes. Burger is done when surface is cracked, and
            juices start to rise to the top.</li>
    </ol>
